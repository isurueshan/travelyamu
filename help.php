    With so many amazing activities on travelyamu.com, we know it can be tough to choose! Here’s a good way to narrow it down:<br>
<ul>
    <li>	Enter your destination (i.e. Kuala Lumpur,Singapore,Sri Lanka etc.) into the search box on travelyamu.com. From there, you can choose to view:</li>
<li>	The main page for your destination, which features our most popular tours and activities in that place.</li>
<li>	Specific activities in your destination.</li>
<li>	Attraction and recommendation pages, which include insider tips about the top things to do in your destination.</li>
<li>	You can also use the left navigation bar to look at types of activities in a particular destination, such as food tours, helicopter rides, etc.</li>

Tip: All of the activities you see are offered “as is,” which means they can’t be customized. But don’t worry, we have tons of options (and some tours with multiple options!), and we’re sure you’ll find the perfect activity for your trip.

    Generally speaking, if a tour operator is asking for your weight or age, it’s to ensure your safety during the tour.<br>
    Weight is required for most tours that involve flying (for example: helicopter tours).<br>
    Age may be requested for liability or insurance reasons, or to ensure you’re getting the best price.<br>

        There are a few reasons your tour may not show in your account.  
1.	The most common is due to creating two accounts with Travel Yamu. Many of our customers use the Facebook login feature.  The email address associated with your Facebook account may differ from your main email account.  Tours booked on Travel Yamu will always appear in the account associated with the email address you used while placing the reservation. If you make a booking with a different email address, it will generate a new account for that email.  
2.      Secondarily, if you’ve booked through one of our Partner sites and NOT directly through Travel Yamu, your tour will not show up in your Travel Yamu account. Please rest 
  
If your tour has been cancelled by the local tour operator, you may request a refund through your Travel Yamu account. To access your account:

1.	Click on the My Bookings tab to see all of your past itineraries (they will display up to 90 days after the travel date).
2.	You can expand your itinerary details by clicking on the + (plus) icon next to the itinerary number. 
3.	Find the booking that you need refunded.
4.	Go to the greyed box underneath your booking details labeled Manage your Booking.

        There are a few reasons why you may be unable to cancel your booking.
If you're unable to request a change through your account, one of two things may be the reason:
A. The tour you booked may not be confirmed with the tour operator yet. You may just need to wait for the confirmation to come in so you can request cancellation.
B. The tour you booked may be non-refundable. To check if the tour you booked is non-refundable:
1.	Select Manage your booking
2.	Under the field for the tour, you will see text that reads The local tour operator does not allow changes or cancellations to this booking – all sales are final.

        Most of our transfer providers keep an eye out on your flight for any minor time changes and will automatically update the pickup time.  If there is a significant delay, your flight has been cancelled or your flight number changes, please make sure to contact the local operator as soon as possible to advise your new flight details.  Our Transfer Operators will do their best to accommodate you, provided they are able.  Failure to do so may result in a missed transfer that will not be eligible for a refund.

        In the case of a tour operator cancelling a tour due to lack of numbers or inclement weather, a refund will be provided.    NOTE: Please be sure to reconfirm directly with the local tour operator, as some tours operate in rain or shine (and therefore will not be eligible for a refund.)
If you need any special considerations and have already made your reservation, please contact the tour operator directly using the contact information located under the Important Info section of your voucher.  We can’t guarantee all special requests will be able to be fulfilled – but our suppliers do always try their hardest to help!

        Refunds generally take 3 - 7 business days for the funds to appear in your account.  If your tour was rejected or cancelled very soon after booking, your bank may simply reverse the charge.  In these cases, your bank will generally remove the temporary, pending authorization from your card (usually within 3 days.)
